Latest release
--------------

xrview is currently unreleased, but can be installed from the GitHub
repository via ``pip``:

.. code-block:: console

    $ pip install git+https://github.com/phausamann/xrview.git

This will also install the minimal dependencies for creating HTML plots.
Advanced functionalities such as Jupyter Notebook integration and interactive
viewers will require additional dependencies.
